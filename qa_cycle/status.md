# QA Cycle Status — Legal ZA Full Lifecycle (Keycloak)

- **Branch**: `bugfix_cycle_2026-05-13`
- **Scenario**: `qa/testplan/demos/legal-za-full-lifecycle-keycloak.md`
- **Stack**: Keycloak dev stack (frontend :3000, backend :8080, gateway :8443, portal :3002, KC :8180, Mailpit :8025)
- **Started**: 2026-05-13
- **Mode**: Clean slate. All Docker volumes wiped. Keycloak bootstrapped (padmin only). Orgs/users will be created through real onboarding flow.

## Per-Day Workflow (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

For each day-N walk in this cycle:

1. **QA agent walks Day N end-to-end.** Records every checkpoint PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL with evidence. Files OBS-* gaps for every defect.
2. **Triage every gap.** Product agent reads each new gap and decides: SPEC_READY, WONT_FIX-EXEMPT, or scenario-amendment.
3. **Fix every spec.** Dev agent: reproduce → full verify → marker → commit → PR → review → merge.
4. **PR the bugfix branch into main.** Each fix is its own PR against main.
5. **Address review findings.** All reviewer flags addressed before merge.
6. **Merge.** Pre-merge gate hook blocks unless verify markers are green.
7. **Retest each fix on main with QA agent.** Mark VERIFIED only after observed end-to-end PASS.
8. **Only then advance QA Position.** Day N+1 starts only when all Day N gaps are VERIFIED on main.

## Mandate (from user)
- Only acceptable open gaps: **KYC** and **Payments** integrations not yet wired in.
- **No production data — backward data compatibility is NOT a priority.** All data is disposable.
- No workarounds besides Mailpit API for OTP/invite-link extraction and dev-only Keycloak issues.
- All other bugs must be **fixed** at the checkpoint they appear.
- Reviewed PRs to **main**, merged, retested before continuing.
- Frontend must run **clean** — no JavaScript/Next.js errors in logs.
- No SQL shortcuts. APIs and browser UI only.
- AI provider 5xx → wait and retry, do not stop.

## QA Position
- **Day**: 0 — COMPLETE (32/32 PASS, 0 gaps)
- **Next checkpoint**: Day 1 (Firm onboarding polish)

## Stack State
- Dev Stack: **Running** (backend :8080, gateway :8443, frontend :3000, portal :3002 all healthy)
- NEEDS_REBUILD: false
