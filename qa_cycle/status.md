# QA Cycle Status — Legal ZA Full Lifecycle (Keycloak) — Cycle 2026-06-13

- **Branch**: `bugfix_cycle_2026-06-13`
- **Scenario**: `qa/testplan/demos/legal-za-full-lifecycle-keycloak.md`
- **Stack**: Keycloak dev stack (frontend :3000, backend :8080, gateway :8443, KC :8180, Mailpit :8025)
- **Started**: 2026-06-13
- **Mode**: Clean slate. All Docker volumes wiped. Keycloak bootstrapped (padmin only). Orgs/users created through real onboarding flow.
- **Context**: Regression re-run of the full lifecycle after the 2026-06 simplification roadmap landed on main (26 PRs #1403–#1435: pnpm workspace + @b2mash packages, OrgSettings → @Embeddables, security fixes, expense-markup write path). Previous cycle (2026-05-30) completed ALL_DAYS_COMPLETE; its state is archived at `qa_cycle/_archive_2026-05-30_legal-full-lifecycle-kc/`.

## Per-Day Workflow (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

For each day-N walk in this cycle:

1. **QA agent walks Day N end-to-end.** Records every checkpoint PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL with evidence. Files OBS-* gaps for every defect.
2. **Triage every gap.** Product agent reads each new gap and decides: SPEC_READY, WONT_FIX-EXEMPT, or scenario-amendment.
3. **Fix every spec.** Dev agent: reproduce → full verify → marker → commit → PR → review → merge.
4. **PR the bugfix branch into main.** Each fix is its own PR against main.
5. **Address review findings.** All reviewer flags addressed before merge.
6. **Merge.** Pre-merge gate hook blocks unless verify markers are green.
7. **Retest each fix on main with QA agent.** Mark VERIFIED only after observed end-to-end PASS.
8. **Only then advance QA Position.** Day N+1 starts only when all Day N gaps are VERIFIED on main.

## Mandate (from user)
- Only acceptable open gaps: **KYC** and **Payments** integrations not yet wired in.
- **No production data — backward data compatibility is NOT a priority.** All data is disposable.
- No workarounds besides Mailpit API for OTP/invite-link extraction and dev-only Keycloak issues.
- All other bugs must be **fixed** at the checkpoint they appear.
- Reviewed PRs to **main**, merged, retested before continuing.
- Frontend must run **clean** — no JavaScript/Next.js errors in logs.
- No SQL shortcuts. APIs and browser UI only.
- AI provider 5xx → wait and retry, do not stop.

## Known carry-over exemptions (from 2026-05-30 cycle — do not re-file)
- OBS-201 class: `/api/assistant/invocations` 404 on client detail (AI infra client-side proxy not wired in KC mode) — WONT_FIX-EXEMPT.
- OBS-6001 class: no separate Statement of Account email after closure — working as designed (PortalDocumentNotificationHandler 5-min dedup coalesces closure-pack emails).
- OBS-2101 class: no tariff dropdown on time entry (non-tariff path) — WONT_FIX from prior cycle.
- OBS-701 class: fee-estimate structure/VAT line absent on portal proposal view — WONT_FIX from prior cycle.
- KYC/FICA adapter not configured — expected PARTIAL per mandate.
- Payments: mock gateway only — expected per mandate.

## QA Position
- **Day**: 5 walked — 3 open gaps block the next day (per-day workflow: all Day 5 gaps must be VERIFIED on main before Day 7, the scenario's next day, starts)
- **Next checkpoint**: Day 5 fixes (Dev — order OBS-503 → OBS-505 → OBS-504, one PR each) → retest (QA: repair 4 automation rules via UI, then REQ-0002 Day 4→5 re-walk verifies all three fixes); then Day 7 — Firm drafts + sends proposal (7.1, actor Thandi, firm :3000)
- **Completed**: Day 0 (32/32 checkpoints PASS + 4/4 summary checkpoints PASS, zero gaps — see `checkpoint-results/day-00.md`); Day 1 (7/7 checkpoints PASS + 3/3 summary checkpoints PASS, zero gaps — see `checkpoint-results/day-01.md`); Day 2 (7/10 PASS, 1 PARTIAL-exempt KYC, 2 SKIPPED-exempt + 2/3 summary PASS, 1 PARTIAL-exempt, zero new gaps — see `checkpoint-results/day-02.md`); Day 3 (14/14 PASS + 4/4 summary PASS, zero gaps — see `checkpoint-results/day-03.md`); Day 4 (14/14 PASS + 5/5 summary PASS, zero gaps — see `checkpoint-results/day-04.md`); Day 5 (5/6 PASS + 1 FAIL, 2/2 portal spot-check PASS, 3/4 summary PASS + 1 FAIL — see `checkpoint-results/day-05.md`)
- **Resolved**: none
- **Open gaps**: OBS-503 (HIGH/BLOCKER — portal-submitted docs stuck PENDING, firm Download fails; SPEC_READY), OBS-504 (LOW — activity feed misattributes info-request recipient to actor; SPEC_READY), OBS-505 (HIGH/BLOCKER, escalated from MEDIUM — seeded AI-specialist automations have wrong specialist IDs AND unresolvable `{{event.entityId}}` contextRef; fails on every envelope completion / invoice approval / matter reactivation; frontend dropdown mints broken rules too; SPEC_READY)
- **Fixed (awaiting verify)**: none
- **Exempt gaps**: none (see carry-over exemptions above; Day 2 KYC-not-configured + OBS-201 404s noted under exemptions, not filed)
- **Created Day 0**: org `mathebula-partners` (legal-za, tenant_5039f2d497cf); users thandi (Owner) / bob (Admin) / carol (Member) @mathebula-test.local
- **Created Day 1**: firm branding (logo in S3 `org/tenant_5039f2d497cf/branding/logo.png`, brand colour `#1B3358`); trust account "Mathebula Trust — Main" (Standard Bank · 051001 · 12345678, SECTION_86, Primary, R 0,00)

- **Created Day 3**: matter **Dlamini v Road Accident Fund** — ID `08ad56c4-ff5e-49c2-a034-cb5fa04b462c`, ref RAF-2026-001, RAF template (9 tasks), lead Bob Ndlovu, Work Type Litigation, Court "Gauteng Division, Pretoria", Opposing Party "Road Accident Fund"; info request **REQ-0001** — ID `de3d6962-6018-43bf-852d-d366d1a4d626`, FICA Onboarding Pack (3 items), Sent, due 2026-06-20; magic-link email Mailpit `hhoVkD8UxgQaLsn2dG2oNu` (token `nsJKu6Q0-pI87cRzaViMkltCnxF1hrwoGaPQzusxvFM`)
- **Created Day 4**: Sipho's portal session established via magic-link (no Keycloak); REQ-0001 now **3/3 submitted, envelope IN_PROGRESS** — fica-id.pdf / fica-address.pdf / fica-bank.pdf uploaded+submitted through portal UI, stored in S3 `org/mathebula-partners/project/08ad56c4-…/{07d78e24,60639e26,c13bb325}-…`; awaits firm per-item Accepts (Day 5)

## Tracker

| Gap ID | Summary | Severity | Owner | Status | Day | Notes |
|--------|---------|----------|-------|--------|-----|-------|
| OBS-503 | Portal-submitted FICA documents stuck PENDING — firm-side Download fails ("Document has not been uploaded yet"); docs in S3 but never confirmed | HIGH (BLOCKER) | Dev | SPEC_READY | 5 | Root cause confirmed: `PortalInformationRequestService.submitItem` (L201–228) never calls `document.confirmUpload()`; portal flow has no confirm step; `DocumentService.getPresignedDownloadUrl` (L488–491) gates on UPLOADED. "Silent swallow" secondary claim NOT confirmed in code — `request-detail-client.tsx:479` does `toast.error`; Dev to observe during repro, no speculative frontend change. Fix: status flip in `submitItem`, backend-only, no events. Existing 3 PENDING rows stay (data disposable); retest via fresh REQ-0002 round-trip. Spec: `fix-specs/OBS-503.md`. Effort M. |
| OBS-504 | Matter Activity feed misattributes info-request recipient: "Information request REQ-0001 sent to Bob Ndlovu" (actually sent to Sipho Dlamini) | LOW | Dev | SPEC_READY | 5 | Root cause confirmed: `ActivityMessageFormatter` L101–103 + `getContactName` L276–279 fall back to actorName; `InformationRequestService.send()` L359–363 never writes `contact_name`. Pre-existing since PR #545. Fix: emit `contact_name` from portal contact (repo already injected) + neutralize formatter fallback ("the client contact") to kill the bug class. Spec: `fix-specs/OBS-504.md`. Effort S. |
| OBS-505 | Seeded AI-specialist automation templates can never execute: wrong specialist IDs (INTAKE/BILLING/INBOX vs intake-za/billing-za/inbox-za) AND unresolvable `{{event.entityId}}` contextRef — backend ERROR + AUTOMATION_ACTION_FAILED on every envelope completion; will recur on invoice approval (Day 30+) and matter reactivation | HIGH (BLOCKER — escalated from MEDIUM) | Dev | SPEC_READY | 5 | Two confirmed defects: (A) all 6 INVOKE_AI_SPECIALIST template actions across `ai-specialist-{common,legal-za,consulting-za}.json` use unregistered IDs (`InvokeAiSpecialistActionExecutor:67` → `requireById` 404); frontend `action-form.tsx` L392–394 hardcodes same wrong IDs — user-created rules broken too. (B) `AutomationContext` has no `event` section; `VariableResolver` leaves `{{event.entityId}}` literal → `UUID.fromString` ActionFailure — fixing A alone still fails retest. Fix: correct IDs + contextRef (`{{invoice.id}}`/`{{customer.id}}`/`{{project.id}}`) in 3 packs + frontend dropdown + pack-validity guard test. Tenant repair: UI-edit the 4 broken rules (uninstall blocked by executed-rules gate). Latent since PR #1300; NOT the OBS-201 exemption. Spec: `fix-specs/OBS-505.md`. Effort M. |

| Cycle | Agent | Action | Result |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| 0 | Orchestrator | Archived completed 2026-05-30 cycle state; created branch `bugfix_cycle_2026-06-13`; seeded fresh status.md | Setup complete, Infra agent next |
| 1 | Infra | Clean slate setup: svc stop all, `dev-down.sh --clean` (volumes wiped), `dev-up.sh`, Keycloak bootstrap (padmin only), svc start all, Mailpit cleared, 0 tenant schemas confirmed, padmin token grant verified | All services healthy |
| 2 | QA | Day 0 executed: access request + OTP, padmin approval (legal-za auto-assigned, provisioning COMPLETED), Thandi/Bob/Carol KC registrations, team invites — full onboarding flow via browser UI; Mailpit API for OTP/invite links only | 32/32 checkpoints PASS, 0 gaps; Day 1 next |
| 3 | QA | Day 1 executed as Thandi: logo upload + brand colour #1B3358 (persists across logout/KC re-login, S3-served), LSSA 2024/2025 tariff schedule verified (19 items, 4(a) R 7800/day + 4(c) R 780/hr), Section 86 trust account created (Mathebula Trust — Main, R 0,00) | 7/7 checkpoints PASS + 3/3 summary PASS, 0 gaps; Day 2 next |
| 4 | QA | Day 2 executed as Bob (context swap, fresh KC login): Sipho Dlamini created as INDIVIDUAL with SA Legal promoted fields (ID 8501015800088, Pref. Correspondence EMAIL), conflict check No Conflict (green, History 1), FICA "Verify with AI" disabled (adapter not configured — exempt). Client ID 2211a80a-5523-4a6d-8f96-0d638dff88f6 | 7/10 PASS + 1 PARTIAL-exempt + 2 SKIPPED-exempt; summary 2/3 PASS + 1 PARTIAL-exempt; 0 new gaps; Day 3 next |
| 5 | QA | Day 3 executed as Bob (session carried over): RAF matter created from "Litigation (Road Accident Fund -- RAF)" template (Dlamini v Road Accident Fund, RAF-2026-001, 9 tasks, lead Bob), header card + 7-group tab bar verified by testid, promoted fields inline (Court/Case# on Fields only), FICA Onboarding Pack REQ-0001 sent to Sipho (3 items, due 2026-06-20), portal contact ACTIVE-linked, magic-link email in Mailpit. No-Expenses-subtab proven intentional legal-za dedupe (project-tabs.tsx:163-167) | 14/14 PASS + 4/4 summary PASS; 0 new gaps; Day 4 next |
| 6 | QA | Day 4 executed as Sipho (fresh portal context :3002): magic-link from Mailpit clicked → `/auth/exchange` token login, zero Keycloak; /home pending=1, firm logo + #1B3358 navy verified computed; 3 FICA PDFs uploaded+submitted per-item via portal UI file-chooser (fica-id/address/bank.pdf); envelope SENT→IN_PROGRESS (1/3→3/3), items SUBMITTED; /home pending→0; uploads proven in LocalStack S3 (3 objects under matter path); footer "Powered by Kazi" everywhere; only console error = portal favicon 404 (cosmetic) | 14/14 PASS + 5/5 summary PASS; 0 new gaps; Day 5 next |
| 7 | QA | Day 5 executed as Bob (fresh KC login :3000): Client group tab → Requests sub-tab → REQ-0001 (In Progress, 0/3 accepted, canonical `/information-requests/{id}` link — OBS-501 holds); 3 items Submitted with PDFs; **Download FAIL** — all 3 server actions return `success:false "Document has not been uploaded yet"` silently (docs in S3 but DB rows PENDING; portal flow never confirms upload) → **OBS-503 HIGH**; per-item Accepts 0/3→3/3, envelope auto-Completed "Completed on 13 Jun 2026"; FICA card Done/Verified, canonical link; Activity feed full trail but "sent to Bob Ndlovu" recipient misattribution → **OBS-504 LOW**; Mailpit 3× item-accepted + 1× completed to Sipho; backend ERROR on completion: automation rule invokes non-existent specialist `INTAKE` (registered: `intake-za`) → **OBS-505 MEDIUM**; portal spot-check on live Sipho session: COMPLETED + 3/3 accepted, header `3/3 accepted • status COMPLETED` (OBS-502 holds) | 5/6 PASS + 1 FAIL; 2/2 portal spot-check PASS; 3/4 summary PASS + 1 FAIL; 3 gaps filed (OBS-503/504/505); Day 7 blocked pending fixes |
| 8 | Product | OBS-503 triaged: root cause confirmed by code read (`PortalInformationRequestService.submitItem` L201–228 never confirms upload; `DocumentService.getPresignedDownloadUrl` L488–491 gates on UPLOADED); QA's "silent failure" secondary claim NOT confirmed — `request-detail-client.tsx:479` calls `toast.error` and Toaster is mounted (`app/layout.tsx:50`); Dev to observe during repro. Fix: backend-only status flip in `submitItem`, no extra events; existing 3 PENDING rows left per disposable-data mandate; retest via fresh REQ-0002 round-trip | OPEN → SPEC_READY (HIGH, blocker — Day 7+ / Day 46/60 depend on firm retrieving portal docs); spec `fix-specs/OBS-503.md`, effort M |
| 8 | Product | OBS-504 triaged: root cause confirmed (`ActivityMessageFormatter` L101–103/L276–279 actor-name fallback; `InformationRequestService.send()` L359–363 omits `contact_name`; `PortalContactRepository` already injected). Fix: emit `contact_name` in sent audit + neutralize formatter fallback so missing detail can never misattribute again. `resendNotification` writes no audit row — out of scope | OPEN → SPEC_READY (LOW, non-blocker but mandate requires fix at this checkpoint); spec `fix-specs/OBS-504.md`, effort S |
| 8 | Product | OBS-505 triaged + **escalated MEDIUM → HIGH (blocker)**: cascading — fires on every envelope completion, invoice approval (Day 30+), matter reactivation; admin bell polluted with AUTOMATION_ACTION_FAILED each time. Investigation found a SECOND defect QA's hypothesis missed: `{{event.entityId}}` in all 6 template contextRefs never resolves (`AutomationContext` has no `event` section; `VariableResolver` leaves placeholder literal → `UUID.fromString` ActionFailure) — ID fix alone would still fail retest. Also frontend `action-form.tsx` L392–394 hardcodes the wrong IDs (user-created rules broken too). Fix: 3 pack JSONs (IDs + contextRef) + frontend dropdown + pack-validity guard test, one PR (same-bug-class cluster, authorized). Tenant repair: UI-edit the 4 broken TEMPLATE rules — pack uninstall blocked by executed-rules gate | OPEN → SPEC_READY (HIGH, blocker); spec `fix-specs/OBS-505.md`, effort M. Recommended fix order: OBS-503 → OBS-505 → OBS-504 (separate PRs); single QA retest (REQ-0002 re-walk after UI rule repair) verifies all three |
